<h3 style="text-align:left;font-family:calibri;">What is it about?</h3>

</center>
<p style="text-align:left;font-family:calibri;">So, what is Code Geass about? Well it has epic robot fights which are certainly a selling point, but, it's more of a background thing. The thing the anime focuses on the most is human psychology and some philosophic stuff. Does the way a person fullfils an objective matter? Does the end justify the means? Those are just 2 of the questions this show tackles. 
Leouch Lamperouge is an highschool student in Area 11, 
a colony of The Holy Birtannian Empire. His father, the emperor, exiled him to Japan where his mother would find her end later after a terrorist attack. Fueled by hatred, Lelouch plans to destroy the empire and to create a world in which his younger sister, Nunnaly, could live peacefully. After he receives a special power, Geass, a power with which he can control a person thoughts and actions, from a mysterios woman he can start his plan to destroy the world and rebuild it.

<h3 style="font-family:calibri;">Why is it so good?</h3>
<p style="text-align:left;font-family:calibri;">Some may say Code Geass is just a mash of Neon Genesis 
Evangelion and Death Note, and while it certainly borrows one or two things from both, its plot is <i>very interesting</i>, you'll find yourself at the last episode in no time. In my opinion the most important thing Code Geass
 does right is the ending, which is better than the ending of both Death Note and Neon Genesis Evangelion. There couldn't be a better ending to the story, it doesn't feel unrealistic, 
it's just the right way to end our journey with Lelouch vi Britannia. Even though his death is very sad, the fact that he was willing to give his life for the greater good made his character <i>so</i> much better. His death was foreshadowed in episode 1 when he said “The only ones who should kill, are those who are prepared to be killed.” so after doing many evil actions and killing innocent people, it was only right for him to die as well. He made the world a better place while at the same time helping Suzaku redeem his actions by making him Zero, the knight of justice. </p>
